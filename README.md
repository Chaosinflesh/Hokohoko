# Hokohoko Repository

Hokohoko aims to provide an consistent benchmark for academics and others who
wish to test the efficacy of their algorithms on FOREX speculation.

It provides 7 years of per-minute market data across 50 currency pairs, and
various assessors by which researchers may verify the accuracy of their algorithm.

Information and examples can be found in [Bradley et al].

This repository contains the projects for the three libraries provided by
Hokohoko:

* hokohoko
* hokohoko_assessors
* hokohoko_predictors
