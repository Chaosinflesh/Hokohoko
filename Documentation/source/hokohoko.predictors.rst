predictors
==========

Hokohoko includes a number of predictors for comparison, based on historically influential papers, as well as some common
indicators. These do not necessarily represent the state-of-the-art in foreign exchange technology, but it is hoped that
over time their numbers will be added to with more modern predictors and variants which do, particularly as researchers
make use of Hokohoko to benchmark their work.

Where possible, a predictor or indicator is linked with its original author/proponent.

These are found in the ``hokohoko_predictors`` package.
