# Hokohoko Predictors

This package contains implementations of various FOREX predictors for use with the 
[Hokohoko](https://pypi.org/project/hokohoko) package. Each predictor is attributed
to its author, and attempts to match the published specifications as closely as
possible.

The documentation can be found at [hokohoko.readthedocs.org](https://hokohoko.readthedocs.org).
